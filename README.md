This site is Safe’s personal portfolio presented as a neon, terminal-inspired webpage. It introduces Safe with a short animated welcome, a clear About section (with a sketch avatar), and quick action buttons that share simple, playful terminal commands. The Projects area highlights recent work and videos, and the Social section links to Safe’s profiles. There’s also a small floating mini-terminal for a fun, interactive touch. Overall the page mixes retro terminal vibes with modern neon styling to show Safe’s interests in programming, video creation, and game development.
